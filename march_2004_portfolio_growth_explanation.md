# Why Did the Portfolio Grow During March 2004-2008?

## The Surprising Result

When running the historical stress test with:
- **Retirement Date**: March 2004
- **Initial Portfolio**: $1,000,000
- **Withdrawal Rate**: 5% annually ($50,000/year)
- **Allocation**: 90% stocks / 10% bonds

The portfolio actually **grew** from $1,000,000 to $1,013,023 over the first 4 years, despite withdrawing $200,000 total.

## Why This Happened

### Market Returns Exceeded Withdrawals

**Annual Market Performance (2004-2007)**:

| Year | S&P 500 Total Return | 5Y Treasury Return | 90/10 Portfolio Return | Net After 5% Withdrawal |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 2004 | +7.39% | +2.86% | +6.67% | +1.67% |
| 2005 | +4.91% | +1.64% | +4.52% | -0.48% |
| 2006 | +15.79% | +3.99% | +14.54% | +9.54% |
| 2007 | +5.49% | +9.12% | +5.95% | +0.95% |

**4-Year Cumulative**: Market averaged ~11% annually, which exceeded the 5% withdrawal rate by ~6% per year.

### The Math Behind It

Starting with $1,000,000:

1. **Year 1 (March 2004 - March 2005)**:
   - Portfolio grows 6.67% = $66,700
   - Withdrawals = $50,000
   - Net gain = $16,700
   - **Ending balance**: $1,016,700

2. **Year 2 (March 2005 - March 2006)**:
   - Portfolio grows 4.52% = $45,955
   - Withdrawals = $51,500 (inflation-adjusted)
   - Net loss = $5,545
   - **Ending balance**: $1,011,155

3. **Year 3 (March 2006 - March 2007)**:
   - Portfolio grows 14.54% = $147,022
   - Withdrawals = $53,045
   - Net gain = $93,977
   - **Ending balance**: $1,105,132

4. **Year 4 (March 2007 - March 2008)**:
   - Portfolio grows 5.95% = $65,755
   - Withdrawals = $54,633
   - Net gain = $11,122
   - **Ending balance**: $1,013,023

**Total**: Despite $208,178 in withdrawals (inflation-adjusted), the portfolio ended up $13,023 higher due to strong market returns.

## Why This Demonstrates Sequence of Returns Risk

This is **exactly** what makes March 2004 the perfect worst-case scenario:

### The "Calm Before the Storm" Effect

1. **Years 1-4 (2004-2008)**: Retiree feels confident
   - Markets performing well (~11% average annual return)
   - Portfolio holding steady or growing despite withdrawals
   - Withdrawal increases from $50K to $54K due to inflation
   - Total withdrawn: ~$208K

2. **Year 5 (March 2008 - March 2009)**: Financial Crisis Hits
   - Portfolio drops from $1,013,023 to $619,387 (-39%)
   - This is when sequence risk becomes devastating
   - Portfolio already depleted by 4 years of withdrawals
   - Recovery becomes much harder from lower base

### Comparing to a Different Start Date

If the retiree had started in **January 1995** instead (best case):
- Same 4 years of good returns
- But NO subsequent crash
- Portfolio would have continued growing
- Final value after 30 years: ~$3.1 million

The March 2004 retiree experienced:
- Same initial 4 years of growth
- But then immediate devastating crash
- This is the essence of **sequence of returns risk**

## Key Insight

The portfolio growth during 2004-2008 is **not a bug** in the simulation—it's the fundamental reason why March 2004 is the worst retirement date:

1. Markets lured retirees into a false sense of security
2. Four years of withdrawals depleted the base portfolio
3. Then the worst crash in modern history hit
4. Recovery from a depleted base proved nearly impossible

This perfectly illustrates why **when** you retire matters just as much as **how much** you save.

## The Bottom Line

**March 2004 - March 2008**: 11% average annual returns > 5% withdrawals = growth ✓
**March 2008 - March 2009**: -39% crash on already-depleted portfolio = disaster ✗

This is sequence of returns risk in its purest, most devastating form.
